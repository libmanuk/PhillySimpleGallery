# Philly Simple Gallery
An Omeka plugin that dynamically builds a gallery HTML page using Oral History Item Type database records and the Philly Omeka theme.  The plugin also allows administrators to define a page/tab title and description.  Item records displayed on the gallery page are sorted by the Oral History Item Type Sort Priority field.

##
This plugin was created through a partnership between the Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History and West Chester University and a collaboration between Eric Weig, Doug Boyd, and Janneken Smucker.
